# Include other configuration file for defaults
# Must be first, or will override all previous settings.
# You can also use wildcards to load several files in lexicographic order:
# INCLUDE /etc/runvdr/plugins.d/*
# You may want to use this in ~/.runvdr.conf if you also want to load
# /etc/runvdr.conf. DO NOT create infinite loops with this!
#
# INCLUDE /etc/runvdr.conf
#
# For use with runvdr-conf.d, un-comment this line:
# INCLUDE /etc/runvdr/conf.d/*



##### -------------------------
#####   Common config options
##### -------------------------

# The VDR binary to run:
VDRPRG="/usr/local/bin/vdr"

# Command to load the DVB drivers
# DVBLOAD will be launched before VDR starts and whenever the drivers
# need to be reloaded.
DVBLOAD=''

# Command to unload the DVB drivers
# DVBUNLOAD will be launched whenever the drivers need to be reloaded.
DVBUNLOAD=''

# Use VIDEODIR as video directory. The default is /video.
VIDEODIR="/video"

# Read config files from directory CONFIGDIR (default is to read them
# from the video directory).
CONFIGDIR="/video"

# Location of locale files for VDR 1.5.14 and newer. Default is to use
# the builtin "./locale" or whatever was compiled as LOCDIR into VDR.
# 
# LOCALEDIR="/usr/src/vdr/locale"

#####   Plugins
##### -----------

# Load a plugin, defined by the given options. The first word in
# options must be the name of an existing vdr plugin, optionally
# followed by a blank separated list of command line options for
# that plugin. If options contains any blanks, you need to enclose
# it in quotes, like for example
#
#   AddPlugin hello -b -a "A B C"
#
# which would load a plugin named "hello", giving it the three 
# command line options "-b", "-a" and "A B C"
#
# Note: Using the command line option --plugin and -P requires additional
# quoting. The corresponding command line would be:
#
#   runvdr --plugin "hello -b -a \"A B C\""
#
# Add as many plugins as you want here:
AddPlugin 
AddPlugin
AddPlugin
AddPlugin
AddPlugin

# Search for plugins in directory LIBDIR. Default is ./PLUGINS/lib.
LIBDIR=

# If you use PluginSetup: Where is the the plugin_setup_runvdr.conf file?
# PLUGINSETUPCONF="$CONFIGDIR/plugins/plugin_setup_runvdr.conf"

#####   More config options
##### -----------------------

# Run as user VDRUSER in case vdr was started as user 'root'. Starting vdr as 
# 'root' is necessary if the system time shall be set from the transponder 
# data, but for security reasons vdr can switch to a lesser privileged user
# id during normal operation.
USER=""

# Write the EPG data into EPGFILE. Default is /video/epg.data. 
# Use EPGFILE=- to disable this. If EPGFILE is a directory, the file 
# epg.data will be created in that directory.
EPGFILE=""

# Call RECORDCMD before and after a recording.
RECORDCMD=""

# Call SHUTDOWN to shutdown the computer.
SHUTDOWN=""

# Send Dolby Digital audio to stdin of the command AUDIO:

# Set logging to level. 0 = no logging, 1 = errors only,
# 2 = errors and info, 3 = errors, info and debug. The default
# logging level is 3. If logging should be done to LOG_LOCALn
# instead of LOG_USER, add '.n' to LEVEL, as in 3.7 (n=0..7).
LOGLEVEL=3

# Mute audio of the primary DVB device at startup. Set to anything
# to mute, keep clear for not.
MUTE=

# Use SVDRPPORT port for SVDRP. A value of 0 turns off SVDRP. The default
# SVDRP port is 2001. You need to edit the file svdrphosts.conf
# in order to enable access to the SVDRP port.
SVDRPPORT=

# Activate the watchdog timer with a timeout of sec seconds. A
# value of 0 (default) disables the watchdog.
WATCHDOG=90

# Run in daemon mode (implies NOKBD=1)
# Set to anything to activate:
DAEMON=

# Write images from the SVDRP command GRAB into the given directory. 
# GRAB must be the full path name of an existing directory, without 
# any "..", double '/' or symlinks. By default, or if GRAB=- is given, 
# grabbing images to disk is disabled.

# Use a LIRC remote control device. If set to 1, vdr uses /dev/lircd.
# If not set, or set to 0, don't use LIRC.
LIRC=

# Don't use the keyboard as an input device. Set to anything.
NOKBD=

# Use a serial port remote control device. If set to 1, vdr uses /dev/ttyS1.
# If not set, or set to 0, don't use rcu.
RCU=

# encode special characters in recording names to avoid problems 
# with VFAT file systems
VFAT=

# Allow coredumps if USER= is given (debugging)
# USERDUMP="1"

# Store PID of runvdr into a file?
# RUNVDRPID=~/.runvdr.pid
RUNVDRPID=/var/run/runvdr.pid

# Set the controlling terminal. For example, /dev/tty8
TERMINAL=/dev/tty8

# This affects sort options in recordings.
# LANGUAGE="de_DE@euro"

# Additional parameters to pass to VDR directly, without parsing:
ADDPARAM=""

# Command wrapper. Will be placed in front of the VDR command.
# Example:
# WRAPPER="gdb --args"
# WRAPPER="valgrind"
