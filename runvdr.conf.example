#####   Plugins
##### -----------

# Load a plugin, defined by the given options. The first word in
# options must be the name of an existing vdr plugin, optionally
# followed by a blank separated list of command line options for
# that plugin. If options contains any blanks, you need to enclose
# it in quotes, like for example
#
#   AddPlugin hello -b -a "A B C"
#
# which would load a plugin named "hello", giving it the three 
# command line options "-b", "-a" and "A B C"
#
# Note: Using the command line option --plugin requires additional
# quoting. The corresponding command line would be:
#
#   runvdr --plugin "hello -b -a \"A B C\""
#
# Add as many plugins as you want here:
AddPlugin 
AddPlugin
AddPlugin

#####   More config options

# Run as user VDRUSER in case vdr was started as user 'root'. Starting vdr as 
# 'root' is necessary if the system time shall be set from the transponder 
# data, but for security reasons vdr can switch to a lesser privileged user
# id during normal operation.
VDRUSER=""

# Write the EPG data into EPGFILE. Default is /video/epg.data. 
# Use EPGFILE=- to disable this. If EPGFILE is a directory, the file 
# epg.data will be created in that directory.

# Example:
# WRAPPER="gdb --args"
